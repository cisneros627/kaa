#Kaa

In Video Production it's often very important to track the assets being utilized
in your projects. This includes licensed music that will need to be accounted
for when paying out artist for royalties. Length of music may sometimes be
negotiate in contracts for payment. This tool works with the
EDL(Edit Decision List) file, which is the most ubiquitous format for popular
editing softwares to extrapolate and calculates the necessary information
from the timeline and creates a .CSV file for human readable access.  

Kaa is the name given to the snake in Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book Stories
made famous by the 1967 Disney film. I found it fitting since this project
is being developed in the Python language and for a post production
coordinator at Disney.
